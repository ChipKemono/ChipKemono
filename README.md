# ðŸ‘‹ Konnichiwa!
My name's **Kane Mattsuki**, I'm a full stack programmer, and virtual reality enthusiast from the United Kingdom. I'm currently working on some personal projects which are mostly related to things I am passionate about.

My strongest languages have to be **C#**, **TypeScript** and **Python**, but I also have experience in some other languages too. And a fun fact about me: I don't really like style-sheet based UI frameworks, they're confusing to me.

## ðŸ“« Reaching Me

## ðŸ›  My Projects
I've made / am making a few cool projects, mostly just for fun or to fix small issues I have in my day to day life, public or private, they're listed here if I think they're cool.

Again, they're in a dropdown as to not flood this page.

> [!WARNING]  
> These projects are just ideas that I've had, and there is **NO GUARANTEE** that they will ever be brought to fruition. *You can blame shiny object syndrome for that one.*
>
> Items may be added or removed at any time, and may be updated to reflect their progress.
>
> **P.S Sorry for a lack of links!** I tend to keep repositories private until I've got a working prototype, which I haven't for most of these.
