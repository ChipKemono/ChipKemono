# üëã Hallo, ich bin Chip!
I write a lot of code in my free time. I am also an avid VR enthusiast!

## üñ•Ô∏è Languages
I'm fluent in C#, TypeScript and Python, and I am always striving to improve my skills in other languages!~

## ‚ùì What do I do?
I like to reverse engineer things!

### At the moment...
...I'm reverse engineering the [`.resonitepackage`](https://wiki.resonite.com/ResonitePackage) format. This will enable me to work on the Refract project.

Refract aims to be an "Avatar SDK" for Unity, designed for Resonite. It works by utilising the VRChat SDK or ChilloutVR CCK to locate avatars in the scene, and allows you to "build" them into a Resonite package in one click!

There's not a lot to share on the state of that right now, but keep an eye out on my repos for something under that name :^]
